#+title: Pgrapher Reference Configuration

This area holds a set of configuration files spanning many targets.
It is self-contained except for depending on the files at the top of
the ~cfg~ package.

* Organization

The *reference configuration* files are factored into sub-directories
according to their scope of use.

- [[./ui/]] :: configuration which targets a specific user interface (eg
               [[./ui/cli/]] and [[./ui/wcls]])

- [[./common/]] :: "base objects" and other structures and functions
                   shared by the other scopes.

- [[./experiment/]] :: reference configuration specific to one experiment
     or detector (eg [[./experiment/uboone/]])

- [[./test/]] :: it should be possible to individually compile all files
                 above to JSON but this directory holds some
                 additional files that test integrating files from the
                 above directories.


* Guidelines for developing specific configuration

These reference configurations may be used as a basis for developing
user and/or production configuration.  Some guidelines are given for
their effective use

- clone this ~wire-cell-cfg~ repository but otherwise leave its
  contents unmodified

- maintain a separate directory / repository holding *job-specific*
  configuration which import and extend the ~/pgrapher/~ files.

- mimic the organization patterns described above

- where possible, if a ui, common or experiment file is extended,
  avoid the need for higher levels to access the base.

Note, the *reference configuration* given here is subject to change
without warning in the ~master~ branch.  It will remain stable within
a release branch.

* Checking configuration 

While developing a configuration it is useful to periodically test
that it is correct.  There are several levels at which correctness can
be checked.

** Check syntax

In principle, every Jsonnet file should compile as a "main" file and
testing this is easy.  Simply run ~jsonnet~ specifying the top
directory location for the ~wire-cell-cfg~ package.  Eg:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ jsonnet -J cfg cfg/pgrapher/uboone/test-nf.jsonnet > test-nf.json
#+END_EXAMPLE

If this spits out JSON then the Jsonnet is correctly formed.  Some
common mistakes are:

 - defining an attribute of an object as an exported function.  In
   principle, function values are allowed as long as they are not
   retained in the /configuration sequence/.  A simple fix that allows
   intermediate testing is to define the attribute with ~::~ instead
   of the singular ~:~.

** Check content

There are many ways to check if the configuration is what you expect.  

*** Read the JSON file

The JSON can get big but it's where the truth is.  Remember that units
have been resolved so any quantities are expressed implicitly in the
system of units.

*** Query the JSON file

Lots of tricks can be played with [[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/][jq]].  For example, print out all
configurations for a particular component ~type~:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ jq '.[] | select(.type | contains("Ductor"))' < ../foo.json
{
  "data": {
    "anode": "AnodePlane:uboone",
    "pirs": [
      "PlaneImpactResponse:PIRfield0plane0",
      "PlaneImpactResponse:PIRfield0plane1",
      "PlaneImpactResponse:PIRfield0plane2"
    ],
    "rng": "Random"
  },
  "name": "nominal",
  "type": "Ductor"
}
#+END_EXAMPLE

Find every object that is configured with a ~filename~ attribute set
to some value:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ jq '.[] | select(.data.filename == "ub-10-half.json.bz2")' < ../foo.json
{
  "data": {
    "filename": "ub-10-half.json.bz2"
  },
  "name": "field0",
  "type": "FieldResponse"
}
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Check graph

Just having correct syntax goes a long way to having correct
configuration but of course it does not guarantee correct content and
semantics.

Much of the configuration culminates in the Pgrapher component graph.
The ~wire-cell-python~ package provides a utility to generate a visual
representation of this graph which quickly allows problems to be
identified.  Currently, this command needs to operate on precompiled
JSON which can be generated as described by the syntax checking above.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ wirecell-pgraph dotify --jpath '.' test-nf.json test-nf.pdf
#+END_EXAMPLE

The use of ~--jpath '.'~ is to tell the command how to locate the
~edges~ attribute.  By default the command assumes a full
/configuration sequence/ with the ~Pgrapher~ configuration object as
the last element.

** Check C++ defaults

The C++ components hard-code some default configuration.  See [[https://wirecell.github.io/news/posts/default-config-dumper/][this blog entry]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ wire-cell -p WireCellApps -p WireCellGen -a ConfigDumper > foo.json
$ jq '.[]|select(.type|contains("Ductor"))' < ../foo.json
{
  "data": {
    "anode": "AnodePlane",
    "continuous": true,
    "drift_speed": 0.001,
    "first_frame_number": 0,
    "fluctuate": true,
    "nsigma": 3,
    "pirs": [],
    "readout_time": 5000000,
    "rng": "Random",
    "start_time": 0,
    "tick": 500
  },
  "name": "",
  "type": "Ductor"
}
{
  "data": {
    "anode": "AnodePlane",
    "chain": [],
    "continuous": false,
    "first_frame_number": 0,
    "readout_time": 5000000,
    "start_time": 0
  },
  "name": "",
  "type": "MultiDuctor"
}
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Check usage

Finally, one must use the configuration and validate results.  Usage
is described above.


* Usage


** Command line

In general, one runs a WCT command line interface job like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ wire-cell [...] -c pgrapher/cli/main-<SOME-LABEL>.jsonnet
#+END_EXAMPLE

Depending on the ~cli/main*-.jsonnet~ file selected, some additional
command line arguments may be required to set Jsonnet variables or
supply Jsonnet code snippets.  See the comments at the top of the
~main-*.jsonnet~ file selected.
